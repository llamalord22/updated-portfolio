      <img src="assets/images/image2.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="profile">

      <p>I was born in Arlington, Texas but raised in Round Rock, and I love the Austin area. I previously worked at Blizzard Entertainment as a Technical Support Specialist for several years. After about four years I decided I needed a change and enlisted in the United States Air Force where I did Jet Engine work on the B-1 Lancer. When my time in the Air Force was up, I decided that I should pursue coding, and any oppurtunities that it might present me</p>
        
      <p>I am a Llama enthusiast and enjoy all things Llama, in truth it started as something of a joke in middle school that stuck. My friends and family all get me llama related presents anytime they come across them.</p>

      <p>I have always had a passion for technology, and I started making my own basic websites for video games when I was about fourteen years old. I truly hope to transition this passion into a career.</p>
